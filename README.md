# Predicting-CO2-Emission-By-Cars.

## Problem Statement :
CO2 Emissions by cars has been a major cause for global warming. Analysing the total CO2 emissions emitted by cars of Canada

## Objective:
Predicting CO2 emissions emitted by vehicles of Canada

## Algorithms Used :
In this project we have used Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest. We also added Regularization Techniques (Ridge and Lasso) to check the performance of the models

## Final Model Algorithm :
Among the models that we tried building, Random Forest performed the best in terms of r2 score

## Model Performance Measures :
Random Forest
RMSE: 4.2504

MAE: 2.3200

R2_score: 0.9950
